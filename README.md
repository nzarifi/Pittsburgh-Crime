# Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data
 

Arrest data contains information on people taken into custody by City of Pittsburgh police officers. More serious crimes such as felony offenses are more likely to result in an arrest. All data is public with the exception of sex crimes, which are reported at the police zone level. This dataset does not contain incidents that solely involve other police departments operating within the city. There is a clear guideline (referring to page. 2) that eases the understanding of the information reported for each columns. The Pittsburgh Police Arrest Data is up to date and it was downloaded from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/pittsburgh-police-arrest-data on March 26, 2019. Therefore I kept the data from the January 2016 as of March 2019.
